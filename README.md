# Python: the Multi-tool for System Management

This is the companion repo for one of the talks at the
[OLF 2022 conference](https://olfconference.org).

With Python, you may already have all you need to configure
and manage a variety of systems, with speed, precision, and very little
excess baggage. In this talk, we consider when and how to use Python for
shell scripting and configuration management, whether the target is an
entire datacenter or just your personal laptop. We explore command
execution, file system manipulation, data wrangling, and downloading
data from web APIs.

Please see the [examples/] directory for various code snippets
shared in the presentation.
