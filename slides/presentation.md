Notes:

- My digital history began with the Commodore 64

Notes:
- The path isn't so much a progression with Python as the goal, but a journey through open source and Linux, and encountering opportunities to help others
- Story of encountering Linux and open source -- an open and inviting landscape
- (With some recommended sites to see)
- Quickly learned that in open source there were many opportunities to help others, offering freely available tools, and my assistance in configuring and using these tools. Such as Linux servers, web application frameworks

Notes:
- I have a hunch that I am not the only one here with the underlying motivation to share and to help
- But this noble adventure is not without its difficulties, right?

Hindered by tasks that are

- taking too much time
- hard to remember
- prone to human error

Notes:

Thus the desire for automation! To improve:
- Efficiency
- Repeatability
- Reliability
