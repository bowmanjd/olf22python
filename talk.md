# Python: the Multi-tool for System Management
__OLF Conference 2022, Jonathan Bowman__

## Introduction (2 minutes)

Welcome. I am Jonathan Bowman. I am a data engineer by day, a hobbyist developer all the time, and I have some experience in IT, in web development, teaching, and consulting. My computer history started in 1982 when my family got a Commodore 64 for Christmas. My parents only bought us two rather boring games, so we kids were left with blinking cursor and the BASIC programming language. That computer became a place to experiment, learn, customize, build, tear down, build again. It was an entire world to constantly explore.

Fast forward to 1999, finishing my Bachelor's degree so I could be a high school English teacher, a geeky cousin of mind told me about Linux. Discovering Linux and open source was like cresting a hill and seeing this infinite landscape stretched out. Like that old Commodore 64, it was a place to learn and build, but even more open. Where information was freely available, and the tools were attainable.

I became a middle and high school teacher, bringing with me that re-kindled interest in building digital things. And I quickly found that this vast open source landscape provided plenty of natural resources for helping others. I evolved into being an IT technician at the school where I worked. Thrived on offering others direction, pointing them to freely available tools. Configuring servers, desktops, web pages to support the adventures that my co-workers and students were on.

And continuing to develop and build on my own, building and tearing down my machines and homelab.

## The benefits of automation

I quickly learned that while building and configuring systems is certainly a lot of fun, there are a variety of tasks that are either:

- tedious
- hard to remember


This need for efficiency and/or repeatability is common, and many tools have arisen over the decades to fill the need.

- Bash
- Ansible


## Automation scenarios

Provisioning, configuration, management/orchestration

## Why Python?

With Python, you may already have all you need to configure
and manage a variety of systems, with speed, precision, and very little
excess baggage. In this talk, we consider when and how to use Python for
shell scripting and configuration management, whether the target is an
entire datacenter or just your personal laptop. We will explore command
execution, file system manipulation, data wrangling, and downloading
data from web APIs.
